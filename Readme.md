# The Flynn project

This project aims write hardware description of soft CPU for educatif
purpose.

## Why "Flynn project"

Because of the Flynn's taxonomy [See wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn%27s\_taxonomy) introducing the
[SISD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SISD),
[SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD),
[MISD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MISD) and
[MIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMD) architecture.

This project concists of
various soft CPU architecture implementation so we decided make a reference to
one of the classification method.

## Language

Q: Why verilog ?
A: Soft-CPU contests (see [RISC-V weeb
page](https://riscv.org/2018/10/risc-v-contest/) mainly use it, however I a
familiar with VHDL and use it everyday I decided to limit this project to
verilog. Futhermore there is great open sources tools targeting verilog.

Q: Other used language ?
A: For scripting we use python (portable, easy to edit, ...) and C/C++ for software
development requiring performance.

Q: Supported development operating syst√®me ?
A: Project tested on linux, should works on Windows but to tested yet.

Q: Compatible FPGA ?
A: Every soft CPU are developped for FPGA (signals initial values...), only
tested on old FPGA but is you can affort a state-of-the-art FPGA your feedback
is welcome.

FPGA in my possession: Xilinx Spartan6, Altera Cyclone II
